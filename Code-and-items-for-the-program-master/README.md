# Code-and-items-for-the-program (by Nkosi) 
To get the program to work download pygame and pygbutton and extract their contents to the site or dist packages folder in your python folder. Save all items in the folders specified by the main program and save the main program and inputbox.py in the same folder. The main menu and options screen is practically complete, let me know of any changes or improvements you want made.
